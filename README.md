# Projects

Welcome to my github!

In this repo are projects of mine I used to investigate the use of different tools. 

Currently there are 4 directories:
1. Biomedical Informatics Capstone
	- My capstone project was developing a protein correlation tool:
		1. Schedule data aggregation, preparation, and transformation.
			- Metadata creation at each step.
		2. Compare hashing/similarity alogrithms. 
		3. 3D protein structure and sequence comparison.
			- Isolating specifically by binding site.
  - This is my most recent project and applies nearly everything I've learned so far as a data scientist.
  - My tool is currently integrated in my employer's pipeline, I'm working on extracting proprietary data so it can be showcased.
  - For now, I have the presentation I gave to my M.S. committee and employer.
	- If you'd like more information please let me know!

2. Machine Learning
  - Here I investigated the performance of various machine learning and deep learning techniques for classifying Alzhiemer's disease.

3. Data Cleaning
	- Cleaned and aggreagted data concerning COVID-19 patients
		- This data must be prepared for forecasting long haul symptoms

4. Data Visualizations & Exploratory Analysis
	- In this directory I have some notebooks containing work with visualizing data in meaningful ways.
